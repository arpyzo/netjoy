# NetJoy

NetJoy is a program that captures and stores basic information about each packet traversing an ethernet interface. The information can then be used to display a variety of network traffic statistics.

## Current state

Right now the code is a ugly, and disorganized serving only as a raw POC.

## wxWidgets

wxWidgets is used to make development easier. Release versions will probably not include wxWidgets.

## Future

Eventually NetJoy will consist of a separate command line collector that feeds packet information into a database, as well as a web-based display that reads from a database.
